                    Hate crimes targeting the Asian Americans has been a big issue during the height of the pandemic. A national report released by a nonprofit alliance <strong> Stop AAPI Hate </strong> has tracked incidents of hate violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in U.S, since the beginning of the COVID-19. I was also inspired by an article published by The New York Times last April, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/03/us/anti-asian-attacks.html">Swelling Anti-Asian Violence: Who Is Being Attacked Where</a>, capturing a sense of the rising tide of anti-Asian bias nationwide.

                    From March 19, 2020 to December 31, 2021, over 10,000 hate incidents against AAPI persons during the height of the pandemic, according to Stop AAPI Hate. Individual victims who were able to identify their race, gender and age range are categorized and displayed as below:

                    Among 10,905 reported cases, the victims of Chinese descent (42.8%) comprises the largest category of total reported incidents, followed by 16.1% of Korean Americans and 8.9% of Pilipinx. Also, 2% of the victims described themselves with Indian origin. Thai descent and Hmong descent were both reported with a percentage of 1.7. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Victims who identified themselves as Lao, American Indian or Alaska Native, Indonesian, Mongolian, Pacific Islander were included in the report with each percentage less than 1%.

                    Asian females are always the most targeted group when it comes to hate crime. Of 10,525 cases reported by Stop AAPI Hate, 62% victims identified themselves as females. However, now even if the country is ending the mask mandates with everyone adjusting to the new normal, during the post-COVID, this ongoing Anti-Asian sentiment never seems to end.

                    One year after the Atlanta spa shootings with six Asian descent women being killed, early January this year, another Asian woman was fatally pushed in front of an oncoming train at Times Square Station in New York City. A month later, Christina Yuna Lee, a Korean-American woman who lived in Chinatown neighborhood, was stabbed to death after a man followed her into her apartment. In this March, a 67-year-old woman of Asian descent was punched 125 times by a man in Yonkers, New York.

                    Not only did AAPI women become easy prey to hate crime, a spotlight was also thrown on the young Asian adults. The report shows AAPI people aged between 26 and 35 years old were with the highest percentage (30%) out of 9,740 reported cases, followed by 36-45 age group with 21%.
